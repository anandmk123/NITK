\begin{frame}[t]{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This project focuses on developing a \textbf{Conversational Used Car Price Predictor}, integrating a chatbot interface with a machine learning model.
        \item \textbf{Goal:} To allow users to interact through natural conversation rather than filling out traditional forms to predict used car prices.
        \item The chatbot will collect necessary car details (brand, model, year, mileage, etc.) step by step through an intuitive and engaging interface.
        \item A machine learning model will use the gathered data to predict the price of the used car, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.
        \item The chatbot also handles additional queries, such as explaining how the price was calculated or what factors affect the car’s value.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{System Flow Explanation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user interacts with the system via a chat interface in the frontend, initiating a conversation to predict the price of their used car.
        \item The user inputs (car details such as make, model, year, mileage, etc.) are processed by the \textbf{Rasa Engine}, which handles NLP and conversation management.
        \item The Rasa Engine extracts relevant parameters from the conversation and sends them to the backend, where the \textbf{Price Prediction Model} calculates the car's estimated price based on the input features.
        \item \textbf{SHAP} (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is applied to explain the contribution of each feature (e.g., mileage, car age, etc.) to the final price prediction, identifying the most impactful factor.
        \item The backend returns both the predicted price and the explanation of the most significant contributing factor, which are displayed to the user through the chat interface.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Implementation of Random Forest for Price Prediction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Categorical features (\texttt{fuel\_type}, \texttt{transmission\_type}, \texttt{brand}, \texttt{model}) encoded using One-Hot Encoding.
            \item Numerical features (e.g., \texttt{mileage}, \texttt{engine}, \texttt{year\_of\_manufacture}) normalized using \texttt{StandardScaler}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Model Building:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Random Forest Regressor} used for price prediction.
            \item Hyperparameter tuning with \texttt{RandomizedSearchCV} to optimize:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{n\_estimators}: Number of trees in the forest.
                \item \texttt{max\_depth}: Maximum depth of each tree, controlling tree complexity.
                \item \texttt{min\_samples\_split}: Minimum samples required to split an internal node.
                \item \texttt{min\_samples\_leaf}: Minimum samples required to be at a leaf node.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Model Evaluation:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{R² Score:} 0.93, indicating strong model fit and that 93\% of the variance in car prices is explained.
            \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE):} 60,893.98, representing the average deviation from actual prices.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Finding the Most Influential Feature using SHAP Values}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The input data is first preprocessed using the same steps as during model training, ensuring consistency in feature transformations.
        \item SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are then calculated to explain the contribution of each feature to the model’s predicted output.
        \item The SHAP values quantify the impact of each feature, allowing us to identify which feature has the maximum influence on the predicted price.
        \item The feature with the highest SHAP value is considered the most influential in determining the car's price.
        \item The percentage contribution of this most influential feature is computed by dividing its SHAP value by the predicted price, giving an understanding of its relative importance.
        \item This process helps to interpret the model’s decision-making by identifying the key factors driving the price prediction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

        \item Rasa is an open-source framework for building conversational AI applications, supporting both rule-based and machine-learning-driven chatbots.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Rasa Core Workflow}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item User input is processed by the NLU module to identify \textbf{intents} and \textbf{entities}.
            \item The extracted information is passed to the \textbf{dialogue manager}, which uses a set of rules to decide the next action.
            \item The bot executes the selected action, such as providing a response or performing a backend operation.
            \item The conversation state is updated to ensure continuity in subsequent interactions.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Intents Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What is an Intent?} \\
        An intent represents the user's goal or purpose behind a specific input. It helps the chatbot understand the context of the conversation and respond accordingly.
        
        \item \textbf{Greet}: Recognizes user greetings and initiates the conversation.
        \item \textbf{Goodbye}: Handles farewell phrases to end the conversation.
        \item \textbf{Affirm}: Detects user confirmation or agreement.
        \item \textbf{Deny}: Identifies when the user disagrees or negates a statement.
        \item \textbf{Bot Challenge}: Handles questions about the chatbot's identity.
        \item \textbf{Inform}: Collects user-provided details about the car (e.g., brand, model, mileage).
