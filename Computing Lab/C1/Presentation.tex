\begin{frame}[t]{Proposed Methodology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduct requirement analysis to identify user needs and key functionalities.
        \item Design the dialogue flow, defining user intents and entities for intuitive interactions.
        \item Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries to process user input.
        \item Generate appropriate responses based on user queries.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Finalized Design of Solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{System Architecture:}

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Flowchart2.png}
    \end{figure}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Frontend:} A website providing a chat interface for users to interact with the system.
            \item \textbf{Backend:} A server that processes user inputs, communicates with the Rasa NLP engine and the prediction model, and handles responses.
            \item \textbf{NLP Engine:} Processes natural language inputs, extracts intents and entities, and manages conversation flow.
            \item \textbf{Prediction Model:} A machine learning model that predicts the price of the car based on the extracted data from user inputs.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Experimental Setup}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating a responsive chat interface.
        \item Backend: Python (Flask or Django) to handle interactions between the frontend, Rasa NLP engine, and the prediction model.
        \item NLP Engine: Rasa will be used to implement a rule-based chatbot. It will process natural language inputs to extract intents and entities, and trigger predefined actions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Intents:} User intents include providing car details, requesting price prediction, and asking for help or guidance.
            \item \textbf{Entities:} The chatbot will extract entities such as car make, model, year, mileage, and kilometers driven from the conversation.
            \item \textbf{Actions:} Actions include validating user input, passing car details to the prediction model, and returning the predicted price.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Prediction Model: Machine learning model (random forest or any other regression model) for predicting used car prices based on user inputs.
        \item Dataset: The dataset for training the prediction model will be sourced from Kaggle.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Expected Outcomes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A user-friendly conversational interface that will guide users through the process of providing necessary car details in a natural and interactive manner.
        \item Successful integration of the Rasa rule-based chatbot for handling user inputs, understanding intents, and extracting entities such as car make, model, year, and mileage.
        \item An accurate machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices based on the extracted details.
        \item Seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and prediction model to provide real-time price estimates to users.
        \item A comprehensive, interactive system that enhances user experience by simplifying the process of car price prediction through conversational interface.
