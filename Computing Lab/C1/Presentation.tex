        \begin{itemize}
            \item Conversational interfaces enhance interaction with technology.
	\item With the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversational interfaces, chatbots have become an effective way to improve user experience and interaction by providing a more natural, engaging, and flexible platform.
            \item By integrating a chatbot into a used car price prediction system, users can interact in a more conversational way

    \begin{columns}
        \column{0.6\textwidth}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Predicting used car prices requires multiple parameters such as manufacturer, model, year, mileage, etc.
        \item Traditional methods require users to interact with a web form or mobile app input fields to submit the necessary car details,which are often less interactive and user-friendly.
        \item This project aims to develop a chatbot integrated with a price prediction model for a more intuitive user experience.

\begin{frame}[t]{Proposed Methodology}

        \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Proposed.png}  % Replace 'your_image.png' with your image file
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conversational Interface:} A chatbot will serve as the main interaction tool, enabling users to enter car details via natural conversation instead of forms.
    
    \item \textbf{Guided Data Collection:} The chatbot will gather car details (model, year, mileage, etc.) step by step, ensuring ease of use.
    
    \item \textbf{Handling Queries:} The chatbot will also respond to general queries like "How is the price calculated?" or "What factors affect my car's value?"

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Finalized Design of Solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{System Architecture:}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Flowchart2.png}
    \end{figure}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{NLP Engine:} Processes natural language inputs, extracts intents and entities, and manages conversation flow.
            \item \textbf{Prediction Model:} A machine learning model that predicts the price of the car based on the extracted data from user inputs.
            \item \textbf{Frontend:} A website providing a chat interface for users to interact with the system.
            \item \textbf{Backend:} A server that processes user inputs, communicates with the NLP engine and the prediction model, and handles responses.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Experimental Setup}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating a responsive chat interface.
        \item Backend: Python framework (Flask or Django) to handle interactions between the frontend, Rasa NLP engine, and the prediction model.
	\item NLP Engine: Rasa will be used to implement a rule-based chatbot. It will process natural language inputs to extract intents and entities, and trigger predefined actions.
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Intents: User intents include providing car details, requesting price prediction, asking for help or guidance, and asking general questions.
	        \item Entities: The chatbot will extract entities such as car make, model, year, mileage, and kilometers driven from the conversation.
	        \item Actions: Actions include validating user input, passing car details to the prediction model, returning the predicted price, and responding to general queries.
	    \end{itemize}
	\item Prediction Model: A machine learning model (such as Random Forest or another regression model) will be used to predict used car prices based on user inputs, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle for training.

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Expected Outcomes}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item A user-friendly conversational interface that guides users through providing necessary car details in a natural and interactive manner.
	\item Successful integration of the Rasa rule-based chatbot for handling user inputs, understanding intents, extracting entities such as car make, model, year, and mileage, and responding to general questions.
	\item A machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices based on the extracted details.
	\item Seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and prediction model to provide real-time price estimates to users.

    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]{Conclusion and Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This project successfully integrates a conversational interface with a used car price prediction model, making the user experience more interactive and efficient.
        \item \textbf{Future Work:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Introduce voice command functionality for hands-free user interaction.
            \item Add support for multiple languages using translation functionality.
